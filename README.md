### Hi there 👋

My name’s Amir and I’m a sophomore at Georgia Tech who is passionate about creating value by bridging the gap between research and industry.

A quick highlight reel — in the past, I’ve:

- 🔬 built tools to tackle semantic feature learning from unlabeled data in prostate cancer detection at the Stanford Cancer Institute
- 📈 open-sourced a dataset and pipeline for detecting meningitis outbreaks
- 📱researched patterns in social media usage and mental illnesses at Georgia Tech and recommendation systems with Facebook AI Research
- 🤖 represented the UAE internationally at the World Robot Olympiad (where we ranked 8th) with our smart composter project
- 🏥 helped launch Lifeline Pi (a startup that won the $5000 First Act Fund) to connect patients with elderly family members

I do some writing on my [blog](amirbolous.com), am active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amirbolous), and co-host a weekly [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7sTR9PmUy3u0a8LkBIExf5?si=ybE5YnSbSyOaIusHSKz8NQ&nd=1)
