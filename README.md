### Hi there 👋

My name’s Amir and I’m a sophomore at Georgia Tech who is passionate about entrepreneurship, building, and thinking

A quick highlight reel — in the past, I’ve:

- 🔬  built [tools](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11597/115971M/Clinically-significant-prostate-cancer-detection-on-MRI-with-self-supervised/10.1117/12.2581557.short) to tackle semantic feature learning from unlabeled data in prostate cancer detection at the [Stanford Cancer Institute](http://med.stanford.edu/rusulab.html)
- 📈  [open-sourced](https://github.com/amirgamil/Meningitis-Analysis) a dataset and pipeline for detecting meningitis outbreaks
- 📱 researched patterns in social media usage and mental illnesses at [Georgia Tech](https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/) and recommendation systems with [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/)
- 🤖 represented the UAE internationally at the [World Robot Olympiad](https://wro-association.org/home) (where we ranked 8th) with our [smart composter project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnZdy113Lfs&ab_channel=WorldRobotOlympiad)
- 🏥 helped launch [Lifeline Pi](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lifelinepi/) (a startup that won the $5000 First Act Fund) to connect patients with elderly family members

I do some writing on my [blog](amirbolous.com), am active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amirbolous), and co-host a weekly [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7sTR9PmUy3u0a8LkBIExf5?si=ybE5YnSbSyOaIusHSKz8NQ&nd=1)
